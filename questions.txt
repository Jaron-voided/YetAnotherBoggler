1) I can't make interface methods have different parameters for different rabbits, can I?
2) Adding members to IRabbit forces me to make them public, is this ok?
3) I can't have more functions in BaseRabbit, then Overload them for RecursiveRabbit can I? (Passing depth and history)
4) Does Position.Move fail because its a struct? Should I make it a class or just use TryMove (In Position.cs)
5)
